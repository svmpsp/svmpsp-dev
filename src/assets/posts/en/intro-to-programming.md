## Lesson 1: Introduction to Programming?

Welcome to the world of programming with Python!

In this first lesson, we'll introduce you to the basics of programming and why it's an exciting field to explore.

### What is Programming?

Programming is the process of making a computer do your work for you. With programming we can automate repetitive tasks and we can focus on what matters the most.

Technically, programming is the process of designing, writing, testing, and maintaining the source code of a computer programs. This source code is written in one or more programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++, or many others.

Think of programming like building with LEGO bricks. You have individual blocks (source code) that can be connected in different ways to create a structure (program). Just as you need to follow certain rules and guidelines when building with LEGOs, programmers follow specific rules and guidelines when writing code to ensure it works correctly and efficiently.

### Why is Programming Important?

Programming has become an essential part of our daily lives.

You can probably apply programming to automate the boring parts of your daily work, like sending an email each week, or analyzing a spreadsheet to extract relevant information or graphs.

Additionally, programming is used in:

1. **Web development**: Building websites, web applications, and mobile apps that we use every day.
2. **Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)**: Creating intelligent systems that can learn from data and make decisions.
3. **Gaming**: Developing video games that entertain and challenge us.
4. **Scientific research**: Analyzing large datasets, simulating complex phenomena, and discovering new insights.
5. **Automation**: Controlling robots, drones, and other machines to perform tasks efficiently.

### What is Python?

Python is a popular programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and ease of use. Althought it is not the fastest programming program available, its ease-of-use makes it perfect for running small programs and automating small tasks.

Nonetheless, it can also be used for bigger projects such as:

1. **Web development**: Building web applications and scraping data from websites.
2. **Data analysis**: Working with large datasets, performing statistical analyses, and visualizing results.
3. **Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)**: Training models, classifying data, and making predictions.

All of these concepts might sound weird at first, but do not worry. We will describe each step in a simple way to make programming sound intuitive and fun.

### Next Steps

In the next lessons, we'll explore the basic syntax of Python and write our first program. Don't worry if you're new to programming; we'll take it one step at a time!
