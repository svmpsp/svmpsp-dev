In this first lesson, we'll introduce you to the basics of programming and why it's an exciting field to explore.

### What is Programming?

Programming means telling a computer do your work for you. With programming we can automate repetitive tasks and we can focus on what we are good at: creative thinking and finding new problems to solve.

Technically, programming is the process of designing, writing, testing, and maintaining the source code of computer programs. This source code is written in one or more programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++, or many others.

Don't be scared by terminology here, a "source code document" is simply a file with some words written in it. The words must be valid programming instructions from a programming language. Exactly as you could open a text document and write a letter in Spanish, you could open a document and write a program in Java.

### Why is Programming Important?

Programming has become an essential part of our daily lives. Everything you use, watch, work with, drive works thanks to a computer program.

You can probably apply programming to automate the boring parts of your daily work, like sending an email each week, or analyzing a spreadsheet to extract relevant information.

### What is Python?

In this course we will focus on Python.

Python is a popular programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and ease of use. Althought it is not the fastest programming program available, its ease-of-use makes it perfect for running small programs and automating small tasks.

Nonetheless, it can also be used for bigger projects such as:

1. **Web development**: Building web applications and scraping data from websites.
2. **Data analysis**: Working with large datasets, performing statistical analyses, and visualizing results.
3. **Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)**: Training models, classifying data, and making predictions.

All of these concepts might sound weird at first, but do not worry. We will describe each step in a simple way to make programming sound intuitive and fun.

In the next posts, we'll explore the basic syntax of Python and write our first program. Don't worry if you're new to programming; we'll take it one step at a time!
