In this lesson, we will learn about one of the most powerful data structures in Python: lists.

### What is a List?

A list is an ordered collection of items that can be of any data type, including strings, integers, floats, and even other lists. Think of it like a shopping list where you keep track of all the things you need to buy at the store. Each item on the list has a specific position or index.

### Creating a List

To create a list in Python, you can use square brackets `[]` and separate each item with a comma. Here's an example:

```python
my_list = ["apple", 1, 2.5, "banana"]
```

This creates a list with four items: three strings (`"apple"`, `"banana"`) and one integer (1) and one float (2.5).

### Indexing

Each item in the list has an index or position that can be used to access it. The first item in the list is at index 0, the second item is at index 1, and so on.

Here's how you can access each item in the list:

```python
print(my_list[0])  # prints "apple"
print(my_list[1])  # prints 1
print(my_list[2])  # prints 2.5
print(my_list[3])  # prints "banana"
```

You can also use negative indices to access items from the end of the list:

```python
print(my_list[-1])  # prints "banana" (last item)
print(my_list[-2])  # prints 2.5 (second-to-last item)
```

### Adding Items

You can add new items to the end of a list using the `append()` method:

```python
my_list.append("cherry")
print(my_list)  # ["apple", 1, 2.5, "banana", "cherry"]
```

Alternatively, you can use the `extend()` method to add multiple items at once:

```python
my_list.extend(["orange", "grape"])
print(my_list)  # ["apple", 1, 2.5, "banana", "cherry", "orange", "grape"]
```

### Removing Items

You can remove an item from the list using the `remove()` method:

```python
my_list.remove("banana")
print(my_list)  # ["apple", 1, 2.5, "cherry", "orange", "grape"]
```

If you want to remove multiple items, you can use a loop:

```python
for item in ["banana", "cherry"]:
    if item in my_list:
        my_list.remove(item)
print(my_list)  # ["apple", 1, 2.5, "orange", "grape"]
```

### Slicing

You can access a subset of the list using slicing:

```python
print(my_list[1:3])  # [1, 2.5]
print(my_list[2:])  # [2.5, "banana", "cherry", "orange", "grape"]
```

Slicing allows you to extract a specific part of the list by specifying a range of indices.

### Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about lists in Python: what they are, how to create them, and how to manipulate their contents. Lists are an essential data structure in Python, and mastering them will help you write more effective and efficient code. Practice using lists in your own projects to reinforce your understanding of these powerful structures.

**Homework**

1. Create a list with the names of your favorite foods.
2. Add three new items to the end of the list.
3. Remove the first item from the list.
4. Print out the entire list, including all its contents.
5. Use slicing to extract the last two items from the list.
