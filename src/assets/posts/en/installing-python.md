In this post we will show you how to install Python on your system.

### Why do I need to install Python?

Installing Python means adding the programs required to run Python code on your system. These include:

- the **Python interpreter** - this is the program that reads and executes your Python code.
- the **Python standard library** - this is the code that is used by your programs to do interesting things, such as opening files, connecting to the Internet, manipulating strings, etc.
- **(Optional)** a **code editor** - this is a program to edit documents, like Microsoft Word, but specifically designed to edit code.

<p class="note">
<b>NOTE:</b> multiple <b>versions</b> of Python exist. The latest version is <b>Python 3.12.5</b>.

<br>
For this course any version of Python 3 is fine. Python 2 is an old version of Python and should not be used for new projects.

### How to install Python?

If you are browsing from a MacOS or Linux laptop, Python 3 should already be installed on your system.

The check if Python is installed, go to your Terminal and type:

```bash
$ python --version

Python 3.11.9
```
