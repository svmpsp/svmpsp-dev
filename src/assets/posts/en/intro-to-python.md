Welcome to the world of Python programming!

In this first lesson, we'll introduce you to the basics of Python and set the stage for our journey into the wonderful world of coding.

### What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is easy to learn and fun to use. It's often referred to as "executable pseudocode" because it reads almost like English. This makes it a great language for beginners and experts alike.

Here are some key features that make Python special:

1. **Easy to read**: Python code is written in plain English, making it easy to understand and maintain.
2. **High-level language**: Python abstracts away many low-level details, allowing you to focus on the logic of your program rather than the implementation.
3. **Interpreted language**: Python code is interpreted line by line, making it a great choice for rapid prototyping and development.

### Why Use Python?

So, why should you learn Python? Here are some reasons:

1. **Rapid Development**: Python's syntax and nature make it an excellent choice for rapid prototyping and development.
2. **Easy to Learn**: Python has a clean syntax and is relatively easy to pick up, even if you have no prior programming experience.
3. **Cross-Platform**: Python can run on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
4. **Extensive Libraries**: Python has an extensive collection of libraries and frameworks that make it easy to perform various tasks, such as data analysis, web development, and more.

### Experiment with Python

One of the great things about Python is that is comes with an interpreter, the `python` program. So if you want to experiment or understand a concept better, you can easily start an interpreter session and experiment with the code there.

For example:

```
$ python
Python 3.11.9 (main, Aug  2 2024, 17:55:55) [GCC 11.4.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> a = 123
>>> b = 4
>>> a + b
127
```

This is a great way to learn and to quickly test things out as we dive deeper into programming with Python.

### A note about comments

As in other programming languages, Python supports writing code comments.

Code comments are special parts of the program that are ignored by the interpreter and are used to
comment the code. For example:

```
# This is a comment, the following variables
# represent the current year and month
x = 2023
y = 12
```

When you run this program, the interpreter removes the comments:

```
x = 2023
y = 12
```

Comments should only be used to explain code that is difficult to understand.
It is far better to use variable names and clear code instead of comments.

### Conclusions

In this post we have introduced some of the features of the Python language, and we discussed why it is a good programming language for beginners.
