## Lesson 2: Introduction to Python

Welcome to the world of Python programming!

In this first lesson, we'll introduce you to the basics of Python and set the stage for our journey into the wonderful world of coding.

### What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is easy to learn and fun to use. It's often referred to as "executable pseudocode" because it reads almost like English. This makes it a great language for beginners and experts alike.

Here are some key features that make Python special:

1. **Easy to read**: Python code is written in plain English, making it easy to understand and maintain.
2. **High-level language**: Python abstracts away many low-level details, allowing you to focus on the logic of your program rather than the implementation.
3. **Interpreted language**: Python code is interpreted line by line, making it a great choice for rapid prototyping and development.

### Why Use Python?

So, why should you learn Python? Here are some reasons:

1. **Rapid Development**: Python's syntax and nature make it an excellent choice for rapid prototyping and development.
2. **Easy to Learn**: Python has a clean syntax and is relatively easy to pick up, even if you have no prior programming experience.
3. **Cross-Platform**: Python can run on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
4. **Extensive Libraries**: Python has an extensive collection of libraries and frameworks that make it easy to perform various tasks, such as data analysis, web development, and more.

### Setting Up Your Environment

To get started with Python, you'll need a few things:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install the latest version of Python from the official website: <https://www.python.org/downloads/>
2. **Choose an Editor**: You can use any text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to write your Python code. Some popular options include PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, and Sublime Text.
3. **Get Familiar with the Command Line**: Learn the basics of the command line interface (CLI) to interact with your Python environment.

### First Steps in Python

Now that you have Python installed and an editor set up, let's take our first steps in writing some Python code!

Here's a simple "Hello World" program to get you started:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Run this code by saving it to a file (e.g., `hello.py`) and then executing it using the command line: `python hello.py`

Congratulations! You've just written your first Python program!

In our next lesson, we'll dive deeper into the world of Python, exploring data types, variables, and basic syntax.

### Homework

1. Install Python and set up an editor.
2. Write a simple "Hello World" program using the `print()` function.
3. Experiment with running your code using the command line.

That's it for now! Keep practicing, and you'll be well on your way to becoming a Python master!
