## Lesson: Installing Python on MacOS

**Objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will be able to install and set up Python on their Mac operating system.

**Materials Needed:**

- A Mac computer with an internet connection
- The Python installer (available from the official Python website)

### Step 1: Download the Python Installer

1. Open a web browser on your Mac and navigate to the [official Python download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Click on the "Download Python" button for the latest version of Python.
3. Select the macOS installer (it should be labeled as "macOS x86-64" or similar).

### Step 2: Run the Installer

1. Once the download is complete, open the installer package (it should have a .dmg extension).
2. Follow the prompts to agree to the terms and conditions.
3. Choose the installation location (default is fine).
4. Select whether you want to add Python to your PATH environment variable (recommended for most users).

### Step 3: Install Python

1. The installer will start copying files to your computer. This may take a few minutes.
2. When prompted, choose whether to install pip (the package installer) and/or set up the Python launcher.

### Step 4: Set Up Your Environment

1. Once the installation is complete, you'll need to add the Python executable to your system's PATH environment variable.
   - To do this, open the Terminal app on your Mac (it should be located in Applications/Utilities).
   - Type `echo $PATH` and press Enter to see the current PATH settings.
   - Add the path to the Python executable to the end of the list by typing `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin/python`.
   - Press Enter to save the changes.

### Step 5: Verify Your Installation

1. Open a new Terminal window or tab.
2. Type `python --version` and press Enter to verify that you have installed the correct version of Python.

### Troubleshooting Tips:

- If you encounter any issues during installation, refer to the official Python documentation for troubleshooting guidance.
- Make sure your Mac meets the system requirements for installing Python (usually at least macOS 10.13 High Sierra or later).

### Conclusions

You have successfully installed and set up Python on your Mac! You can now start exploring the world of Python programming using your new installation.
